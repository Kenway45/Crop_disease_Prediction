## 🔮 **What Makes This Special:**

### **Full Quantum Circuit:**
```
q0-q7: 8 qubits creating 2⁸ = 256-dimensional quantum state space
       ↓
4 variational layers with RY/RZ rotations
       ↓
CNOT gates for quantum entanglement
       ↓
Measurements → Disease predictions
```

### **Why PCA Was Essential:**
- Original: 512 dimensions → Would need 512 qubits (IMPOSSIBLE!)
- With PCA: 128D → uses first 8D → 8 qubits (FEASIBLE!)
- **PCA made quantum possible!** 🎯

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

1. **Run the training** (command above)
2. **Wait 15-30 minutes** (watch progress bars)
3. **Model saves automatically** to `artifacts/classifiers/quantum_clf.joblib`
4. **Run demo server** with `python src/demo_server.py`
5. **See both predictions** (classical + quantum!) in browser

## 💡 **Pro Tips:**

### **Want it faster?**
Edit `train_quantum_only.py`:
- Line 75: Change `max_samples_per_class = 50` (instead of 100)
- Line 123: Change `epochs = 15` (instead of 30)
- Result: ~8-12 minutes instead of 15-30

### **Want to see live progress?**
The progress bars show:
- Current epoch
- Batch completion
- Real-time loss values
- Accuracy every 5 epochs

### **How to know it's working?**
You should see:
- Progress bars updating
- Loss values decreasing
- Accuracy increasing
- CPU usage high (check Activity Monitor)
