# 🎯 Training Started Successfully!

## ✅ Current Status

**Training is RUNNING with:**
- 🔧 Device: **MPS (Apple GPU)** - CONFIRMED ✓
- 📊 Dataset: **56,134 images** across **45 classes**
- 🎓 Training: **10 epochs** in progress
- 🚀 Status: **Epoch 1/10 started**

---

## 📍 **HOW TO MONITOR PROGRESS**

### 🔥 **OPTION 1: Live Real-Time Progress (RECOMMENDED)**

Open a **new terminal** and run:

```bash
tail -f /Users/jayadharunr/Crop_disease_Prediction/training.log
```

**Press `Ctrl+C` to stop watching** (won't stop training)

---

### 📊 **OPTION 2: Check Latest Progress**

```bash
tail -50 /Users/jayadharunr/Crop_disease_Prediction/training.log
```

---

### ⏱️ **OPTION 3: Check Epoch Progress**

```bash
grep "Epoch" /Users/jayadharunr/Crop_disease_Prediction/training.log
```

---

### ✅ **OPTION 4: Check Completed Steps**

```bash
grep "✓" /Users/jayadharunr/Crop_disease_Prediction/training.log
```

---

## 🔍 **Verify Training is Running**

```bash
ps aux | grep train_model.py | grep -v grep
```

**You should see output like:**
```
jayadharunr  16349  42.4  4.1  ... python3 src/train_model.py
```

If you see high CPU usage (30-80%), training is actively working! ✓

## 📈 **What to Expect**

### Step 1: Dataset Collection ✓ (COMPLETED)
```
✓ Found 56,134 images across 45 classes
✓ Train samples: 44,907, Val samples: 11,227
✓ Saved class names to artifacts/models/classes.json
```

### Step 2: Training CNN ⏳ (IN PROGRESS)
You'll see progress bars like this:

```
Epoch 1/10 [Train]: 100%|███████| 1404/1404 [12:34<00:00, loss: 1.234, acc: 75.50%]
Epoch 1/10 [Val]:   100%|███████| 351/351 [02:15<00:00, loss: 0.987, acc: 78.20%]

Epoch 1: Train Acc: 75.50%, Val Acc: 78.20%
✓ Saved best model with validation accuracy: 78.20%
```

**Each epoch takes ~10-15 minutes**
- 10 epochs total
- ~1-2 hours for CNN training

### Step 3: Extracting Embeddings (After Epoch 10)
```
Processing 56,134 images...
✓ Saved embeddings: shape (56134, 512)
```
**Takes ~15-20 minutes**

### Step 4: Training PCA
```
✓ PCA trained and saved: 128 components
```
**Takes ~2-3 minutes**

### Step 5: Training Classifier
```
✓ Classifier trained
✓ Train accuracy: 90-95%
✓ Test accuracy: 85-90%
```
**Takes ~1-2 minutes**

## 📁 **Check Created Artifacts**

### Already Created:
```bash
ls -lh /Users/jayadharunr/Crop_disease_Prediction/artifacts/models/classes.json
```

### Will Be Created During Training:

**CNN Model (after best epoch):**
```bash
ls -lh /Users/jayadharunr/Crop_disease_Prediction/artifacts/models/best_cnn.pt
```

**Embeddings (after Step 3):**
```bash
ls -lh /Users/jayadharunr/Crop_disease_Prediction/artifacts/embeddings/
```

**PCA (after Step 4):**
```bash
ls -lh /Users/jayadharunr/Crop_disease_Prediction/artifacts/pca/pca.joblib
```

**Classifier (after Step 5):**
```bash
ls -lh /Users/jayadharunr/Crop_disease_Prediction/artifacts/classifiers/lr_clf.joblib
```

## 🛑 **If You Need to Stop Training**

**⚠️ WARNING: This will interrupt training!**

```bash
pkill -f train_model.py
```

**To restart:**
```bash
cd /Users/jayadharunr/Crop_disease_Prediction
python3 src/train_model.py > training.log 2>&1 &
```

---

## ✅ **When Training Completes**

You'll see this at the end of `training.log`:

```
============================================================
TRAINING COMPLETE!
============================================================

Artifacts created:
  ✓ artifacts/models/best_cnn.pt
  ✓ artifacts/models/classes.json
  ✓ artifacts/embeddings/train_emb.npy

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### Training Stopped?
```bash
# Check if process is still running
ps aux | grep train_model.py | grep -v grep

# If not running, check the last lines of log
tail -50 /Users/jayadharunr/Crop_disease_Prediction/training.log

# Restart if needed
cd /Users/jayadharunr/Crop_disease_Prediction
python3 src/train_model.py > training.log 2>&1 &
```

### No Progress in Log?
The progress bars might not show immediately. Wait 2-3 minutes and check again.

### Out of Memory Error?
```bash
# Edit the script to reduce batch size
nano /Users/jayadharunr/Crop_disease_Prediction/src/train_model.py
# Change line 239: BATCH_SIZE = 16  (from 32)
```
