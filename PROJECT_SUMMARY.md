### **Files NOT Pushed (Too Large - This is Normal!):**

These are in `.gitignore` because they're too large for GitHub:
- ❌ `artifacts/models/best_cnn.pt` (131 MB) - Trained CNN model
- ❌ `artifacts/embeddings/train_emb.npy` (110 MB) - Image embeddings
- ❌ `artifacts/embeddings/train_labels.npy` (439 KB) - Labels

- ❌ `artifacts/classifiers/lr_clf.joblib` (47 KB) - Classifier
- ❌ `data/` folder - Datasets (5GB+)
- ❌ `training.log` - Training logs

**Note:** This is intentional and correct! Model files should stay local or be deployed to cloud storage.

## 🔧 For Collaborators

### **How Others Can Use Your Project:**

**1. Clone and install:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kenway45/Crop_disease_Prediction.git
cd Crop_disease_Prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**2. Download datasets:**
```bash
# Need Kaggle API credentials in ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
python3 src/download_data.py
```

**3. Train model:**
```bash
python3 src/train_model.py
```

**4. Run demo:**
```bash
python3 src/demo_server.py
```

### **Model Artifacts:**

Since model files aren't on GitHub, collaborators need to:
1. Download datasets themselves
2. Run training to generate artifacts
3. Or you can share trained models via:
   - Google Drive
   - Dropbox
   - AWS S3
   - Hugging Face Model Hub

---

## 📈 Next Steps (Optional)

### **1. Deploy to Cloud:**
- Host on Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud
- Make accessible from anywhere
- Set up continuous deployment

### **2. Share Trained Models:**

Upload to Hugging Face:
```bash
# Install huggingface_hub
pip install huggingface_hub

# Upload your model
# (See: https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/models-uploading)
```

### **3. Create Model Zoo:**
Store models in:
- Google Drive (share link)
- AWS S3 (public bucket)
- GitHub Releases (if < 100MB)

### **4. Add Model Download Script:**
Create `download_models.sh` to automatically download trained models for collaborators.
