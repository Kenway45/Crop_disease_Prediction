## 🔬 **How It Works**

### **Pipeline:**

```
User Image
    ↓
🍃 STEP 1: Leaf Detection
    ├─ ✓ Is it a leaf? → Continue
    └─ ✗ Not a leaf? → Reject with message
    ↓
🧠 STEP 2: Feature Extraction
    ├─ CNN extracts 512D embeddings
    └─ PCA reduces to 128D
    ↓
🔮 STEP 3: Pure Quantum Prediction
    ├─ Uses first 8D from PCA
    ├─ 8-qubit quantum circuit processes
    ├─ Quantum measurement
    └─ Disease prediction!
    ↓
✅ STEP 4: Confidence Check
    ├─ High confidence (>30%) → Return prediction
    └─ Low confidence → Suggest better image
```

## 🍃 **Leaf Detection**

### **How It Detects Leaves:**

```python
✓ Green color dominance (>30% green ratio)
✓ Texture variation (has patterns)
✓ Not too uniform (not blank)
✓ Reasonable brightness (not too dark/bright)
```

### **What Gets Rejected:**

❌ Blank walls  
❌ Pure colors  
❌ Very dark images  
❌ Non-plant objects  
❌ Blurry/unclear images  

### **What Gets Accepted:**

✅ Plant leaves  
✅ Crop images  
✅ Clear leaf photos  
✅ Green vegetation

## 🔬 **Technical Details**

### **Leaf Detection Algorithm:**

```python
def is_leaf_image(image):
    # Calculate green channel dominance
    green_ratio = mean(green) / mean(RGB)
    
    # Check texture
    variance = calculate_variance(image)
    
    # Check brightness
    brightness = mean(image)
    
    # Leaf if:
    return (green_ratio > 0.30 and
            100 < variance < 10000 and
            30 < brightness < 240)
```

### **Quantum Prediction:**

```python
# Extract features
embeddings = CNN(image)           # 512D
embeddings_pca = PCA(embeddings)  # 128D

# Quantum processing
quantum_input = embeddings_pca[:8]  # First 8D
quantum_probs = QuantumCircuit(quantum_input)
prediction = argmax(quantum_probs)
```

## 🎨 **User Experience**

### **Good Leaf Image:**
```
User captures leaf
    ↓
✓ Leaf detected
    ↓
🔮 Quantum processing...
    ↓
✓ "Tomato Late Blight" (85% confidence)
```

### **Non-Leaf Image:**
```
User captures wall
    ↓
✗ No leaf detected
    ↓
💬 "🍃 Please capture an image of a plant leaf"
```

### **Low Quality:**
```
User captures blurry leaf
    ↓
✓ Leaf detected
    ↓
🔮 Quantum processing...
    ↓
⚠️ "Low confidence. Please try clearer image."
```

---

## 🔧 **Configuration**

### **Adjust Leaf Detection Sensitivity:**

Edit `src/demo_server.py`, function `is_leaf_image()`:

```python
# More lenient (detects more images as leaves)
is_green_dominant = green_ratio > 0.25  # Was 0.30
has_texture = variance > 50              # Was 100

# More strict (only very clear leaves)
is_green_dominant = green_ratio > 0.35  # Was 0.30
has_texture = variance > 200             # Was 100
```

### **Adjust Confidence Threshold:**

Edit `src/demo_server.py`, function `predict_image()`:

```python
# More lenient (accept lower confidence)
if max_confidence < 0.2:  # Was 0.3

# More strict (only high confidence)
if max_confidence < 0.4:  # Was 0.3
```

## 📊 **What Changed**

### **Before:**
```
Image → CNN → PCA → Classical OR Quantum → Result
```

### **After:**
```
Image → Leaf Check → CNN → PCA → Quantum ONLY → Result
         ↓ (if not leaf)
         ✗ Reject with message
```
